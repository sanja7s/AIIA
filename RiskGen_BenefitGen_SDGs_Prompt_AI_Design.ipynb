        "        2. Evaluate each SDG Goal (described below). Classify the impact on the Goals as \"Positive\", \"Negative\", \"Mixed\", or \"Inapplicable\". When asessing whether the AI system negatively impacts a goal, consider what are the potential biases and harms that might be caused by this system for the goal. To classify the impact for each goal, assess if the introduction of the AI system is:\n",
        "        Positive - the introduction of the AI system improves the developments towards achieving the SDG Goal targets for example, by combating bias, supporting equality, empowering humanity, or enables measuring the Goal's indicators.\n",

        "        Inapplicable – there is no clear indication that the introduction of the AI system improves or deteriorates the developments towards achieving the SDG Goal targets.\n",
        "\n",
        "        3. In each case, rigorously validate your reasoning. Use the generated description of the system to generate a concrete example of how the introduction of this system impacts the developments towards achieving the SDG Goal targets. For the systems classified as Mixed impact, generate both positive and negative impact examples for the SDG Goal. The true intent and capabilities of the AI system are crucial for this evaluation. While evaluating, explicitly cite the SDG Goal definition text (targets and/or indicators) that resonates most with the AI system's purpose and capabilities. Reference the exact text from the respective SDG Goal definition and provide a thorough rationale. Ensure there is a direct correlation between the system's functionalities and the referenced text.\n",

Use the generated description of the system to generate a concrete example of how the introduction of this system impacts the developments towards achieving the SDG Goal targets.

While evaluating, explicitly cite the SDG Goal definition text (targets and/or indicators) that resonates most with the AI system's purpose and capabilities. Reference the exact text from the respective SDG Goal definition and provide a thorough rationale. Ensure there is a direct correlation between the system's functionalities and the referenced text.\n",

        "        2. Evaluate each SDG Goal (described below). Classify the impact on the Goals as \"Positive\", \"Negative\", \"Mixed\", or \"Inapplicable\". When asessing whether the AI system negatively impacts a goal, consider what are the potential biases and harms that might be caused by this system for the goal. To classify the impact for each goal, assess if the introduction of the AI system is:\n",
        "        Positive - the introduction of the AI system improves the developments towards achieving the SDG Goal targets for example, by combating bias, supporting equality, empowering humanity, or enables measuring the Goal's indicators.\n",
        "        Negative - the introduction of the AI system deteriorates the developments towards achieving the SDG Goal targets, for example, by causing harms, reinforcing biases, fostering discrimination, or impeding progress.\n",
        "        Mixed (both positive and negative) - the introduction of the AI system at the same time improves and deteriorates the developments towards achieving the SDG Goal targets\n",
        "        Inapplicable – there is no clear indication that the introduction of the AI system improves or deteriorates the developments towards achieving the SDG Goal targets.\n",
        "\n",
        "        3. In each case, rigorously validate your reasoning. Use the generated description of the system to generate a concrete example of how the introduction of this system impacts the developments towards achieving the SDG Goal targets. For the systems classified as Mixed impact, generate both positive and negative impact examples for the SDG Goal. The true intent and capabilities of the AI system are crucial for this evaluation. While evaluating, explicitly cite the SDG Goal definition text (targets and/or indicators) that resonates most with the AI system's purpose and capabilities. Reference the exact text from the respective SDG Goal definition and provide a thorough rationale. Ensure there is a direct correlation between the system's functionalities and the referenced text.\n",

        "        This assessment requires a deep understanding of both the AI system in question and the definitions of the Sustainable Development Goals. Each evaluation must be backed by solid reasoning and a clear understanding of the interplay between technology and SDG Goals. Remember, precision is paramount. Be succinct.\n",
